## 📸 UI Overview

- Search label + box (live filter)
- Buttons: Refresh, Kill, Suspend, Resume, Export JSON, Export CSV
- "Tree" checkbox to act recursively on children
- Status bar with fixed text
- ListView with processes (PID, PPID, RSS, Name, Path)

## ⚠ Notes

- Some actions require Administrator rights (especially for system/privileged processes).
- `NtSuspendProcess` / `NtResumeProcess` are undocumented APIs available in `ntdll.dll`.
- Memory usage (RSS) is approximate.
- The app intentionally avoids background timers to remain responsive.
